<!-- Common CSS Issues and Debugging Techniques
CSS can be a powerful tool for styling web pages, but it can also be prone to errors. Here are some common issues and how to debug them using browser developer tools:

Common CSS Issues
Conflicting styles: Multiple stylesheets or inline styles can conflict with each other, resulting in unexpected behavior.
Specificity issues: The specificity of CSS rules determines which rule takes precedence. If a more specific rule conflicts with a less specific one, the more specific rule will override the less specific one.
Typographical errors: Even a small typo can prevent a CSS rule from working as intended.
Browser compatibility issues: Different browsers may interpret CSS rules differently, leading to inconsistencies in the rendering of your web page.
Using Browser Developer Tools to Debug CSS
Inspect elements:

Right-click on an element in your web page and select "Inspect" (or a similar option) to open the developer tools.
This will open the Elements panel, where you can view the HTML structure of the page and inspect the applied CSS styles.
Identify CSS problems:

Look for conflicting styles or rules that are not being applied as expected.
Check the specificity of rules to ensure the correct one is taking precedence.
Use the console to log CSS properties and values to help you debug.
Test changes live:

The developer tools often allow you to edit CSS rules live and see the changes reflected immediately in the browser. This can be a valuable tool for debugging and experimenting with different styles.
Example: Resolving a Conflicting Style
Problem:
Let's say you have a <div> element with a class of "container" that you want to have a red background. However, there's another rule somewhere in your stylesheet that sets the background color of all <div> elements to blue. This conflicting rule is overriding your desired style.

Debugging steps:

Inspect the element: Right-click on the <div> element and inspect it.
Examine the styles: Look for any rules that might be affecting the background color. In this case, you'll likely see a rule targeting all <div> elements with a blue background.
Override the conflicting rule: To make your desired style take precedence, you can either:
Increase the specificity of your rule (e.g., by adding a class or ID to the <div> element).
Use the !important declaration to force your rule to override any conflicting rules.
Example solution:

CSS
.container {
    background-color: red !important;
}
Use code with caution.

By adding the !important declaration, your rule will override the conflicting rule and the <div> element will have the desired red background. -->
